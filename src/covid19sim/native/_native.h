/**
 *  Time.
 * 
 *  Time is a complicated business.
 * 
 *  - Everyone agrees what a second, a minute and an hour mean.
 * 
 *  - People will define a day variously:
 * 
 *      - "The time it takes for the Earth to rotate 360 degrees" (sidereal day)
 *      - "The time between consecutive local noons of the Sun"   (mean solar day)
 *          NB: This is not the same as the sidereal day because the Earth,
 *              having advanced along its orbit of the Sun, must rotate a tiny
 *              bit more for the Sun to achieve local noon again.
 *      - "24 hours"                                              (ephemeris day)
 * 
 *    However, if pressed to give an exact duration, most people will agree that
 *    a day is exactly 24 hours, or 86400 seconds (ephemeris day). The definition
 *    of the second makes the mean solar day currently 86400.002 seconds long,
 *    while the sidereal day is only 86164.0905 seconds long (~4 minutes short).
 * 
 *  - Everyone agrees that a week lasts 7 days, but don't agree on the first day
 *    of the week. Python thinks the zeroth day of the week is Monday; C
 *    specifies the zeroth day of the week as Sunday.
 * 
 *  - The definition of a year is most confusing. Some people will say:
 * 
 *      - "The time taken to orbit the Sun once"          (sidereal year)
 *      - "The time between consecutive summer solstices" (tropical year)
 *          NB: This is not the same as the sidereal year because of the
 *              precession of the equinoxes.
 *      - "365 days except on leap years, when there are 366 days."
 * 
 *    The Gregorian calendar leap-year rule (365 + 1/4 - 3/400 ephemeris days)
 *    attempts to approximate the tropical year (because the Paschal computus
 *    is based on the vernal equinox). Most people use the Gregorian calendar.
 * 
 *    Therefore, for very-many-year durations (e.g. a person's age), most people
 *    mean tropical years, but for one year people generally "mean" 365 or 366
 *    ephemeris days.
