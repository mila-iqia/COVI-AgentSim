Class and functions to plan human's schedule.
There are three key functions. First,_patch_schedule, which takes in tentative activities to schedule and make a continuous schedule out of them.
Second, _patch_kid_schedule, which takes a current_activity and future schedule to follow  and makes a continuous schedule out of them.
Third, _modify_schedule, which takes a current a schedule and a new activity that needs to be added and makes adjustment to it accordingly.
