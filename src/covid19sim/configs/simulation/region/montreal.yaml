# contact duration matrices (procedure)
# We use the survey data provdided in us.yaml without density corrections (until we find some study doing it)
# Survey data has mean and 95%CI. We parameterize the duration as a gamma distribution with shape and scale inferred from
# mean and 95% CI.
# Since gamma distribution is not assumed in the survey, we use the survey data as gaussian distribution with sigma inferred from 95% CI.
# We combine this duration data with location based duration distribution which is assumed to be gaussian.
# We obtain location and age based duration matrices via product of two gaussian pdfs as -
# product of two gaussian pdfs is a gaussian with mean = (var1 * mean2 + var2 * mean1) / (var1 + var2) and var = (1/var1 + 1/var2)^ -1
