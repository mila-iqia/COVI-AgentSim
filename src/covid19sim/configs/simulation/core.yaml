# _SURFACE_PROB is an experimental feature to model environmental transmission. Proportion of environmental transmissions can be just maintained by ENVIRONMENTAL_INFECTION_KNOB.
# _SURFACE_PROB: environmental transmission is modeled via surfaces. When an infected person enters a location, a random surface is drawn from the distribution defined by `surface_prob`. Assume that
## virus lives on this for the max duration empirically observed for this type of surface.
##    ** MAX_DAYS_CONTAMINATION defines the maximum days that virus can live on any of these surfaces.
##    ** __SURFACE_PROB defines a probability over these surfaces.
## probability of infection at `t` due to virus on this surface is computed based on the time lapse between the time when location contamination took place and `t`.

# _CONTACT_FACTOR: It amplifies the environmental transmission based on the location type. For example, if the location is `household`, environmental transmission is more likely to take place
## It is a knob on reproductive number of a location
# _PROPORTION_AREA: proportion of city's area that is allocated to this location.
# _OPEN_CLOSE_HOUR_MINUTE: hour, minute at which the place opens. We use 0,0 and 24, 0 to imply all-time open.
# _OPEN_DAYS: refer to the day of the week on which the location is open. 0=Monday, 6=Sunday

# How does interventions affect behavior?

# mean daily interactions affect interactions in two ways -
# (a) Number of interactions are reduced
# (b) probability vector of humans is reduced by a factor

# mobility reduction i.e presence of human in various networks
# In quarantine, (i) all activities are moved to human's household
# (ii) social activities are cancelled
# (iii) if human is a kid, an adult is moved to house (cancelling their activities)
# (iv) if human is an adult and a kid lives there, kid needs to stay at house as well
# For all other levels, human maintain its normal routine and interact with less humans than normal.
