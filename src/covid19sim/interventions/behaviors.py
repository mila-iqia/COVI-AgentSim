"""
Implements human behavior/government policy changes.

- * Behaviors * change the behavior of a human, specifically they can modify the human's propensity to take actions which
reduce their liklihood of infecting others (wearing a mask, washing hands); they can choose to go out less
(reducing gamma and rho); or they can take more distance / reduce time spent with others while out.
